# Pattern: Immutable Artifact

Once a build produces an artifact, it is never modified. The exact same byte-for-byte binary is promoted through all environments.

## Why it's Required
- **Verification Integrity:** Ensures that what was tested in Staging is exactly what runs in Production.
- **Traceability:** Every deployment is traceable to a specific, non-malleable build ID.

## Implementation
- Version artifacts by `commit-hash` or `build-number`.
- Store artifacts in a read-only registry after production promotion.
