# Anti-pattern: Narrative Paragraphs

Using excessive prose (exceeding 2 sentences per paragraph) in technical documentation.

## Why it's Forbidden
- **Low Information Density:** Hard for humans to scan; hard for agents to parse into structured Knowledge Items.
- **Ambiguity:** Prose often hides technical nuances that should be explicit in lists or tables.

## Corrective Action
Bifurcate into atomic lists, tables, or Mermaid diagrams as per the [Document Organization](/docs/governance/standard/document-organization.md) standard.
