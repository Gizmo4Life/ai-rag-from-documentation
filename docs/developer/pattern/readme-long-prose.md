# Anti-pattern: READMEs with Long Prose

README files that exceed 2 sentences of prose per section.

## Why it's Forbidden
- **Scanability:** READMEs should be portals (manifests), not textbooks.
- **RAG Latency:** Large prose blocks slow down agent characterization.

## Corrective Action
Replace prose with Mermaid diagrams or links to atomic detail files.
