# Anti-pattern: T2 with Code Snippets

Mixing implementation details (code snippets) into high-level business logic definitions (T2).

## Why it's Forbidden
- **Fragility:** T2 documents should describe "What" the system does. Code snippets make them brittle and prone to drift during refactors.
- **Context Overload:** Agents and humans need clean abstractions to understand business intent without getting bogged down in mechanics.

## Corrective Action
Move all code snippets to atomic [T3 Modules](/docs/developer/pattern/doc-t3-module.md) or [Restoration Steps](/docs/developer/pattern/doc-ops-restoration-step.md).
